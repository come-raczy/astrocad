# Focuser for OAG

## OAG

This is for FHD-OAG MAX from Player One.
The important dimensions are:

- Base of the helicoidal focuser: D=52.95 mm, H=10.2 mm
- Adjustment ring: D=51.05 mm, H=10.08 mm

The focuser will mount on the base, using the full height (10 mm). This will be pressure fastened, with a single screw
to control the pressure of the assembly.

The adjustment gear will be 8 mm high, and will be pressure-fitted to the adjustment ring.

## Gears

Both gears are herringbone gears, 8 mm high, with a 1 mm module, a pressure angle of 20 degrees, and a helical beta
angle of 20 degrees. The dimensions of the two gears are:

- Adjustment gear: 56 teeth, Pitch Diameter 56 mm (da=58.00 mm, df=53.50 mm)
- Pinion: 18 teeth, Pitch Diameter 18 mm (da=20.00 mm, df=15.50 mm)

## Motor

Using the usual stepper motor 28BYJ-48. The important dimensions are:

- Shaft: Length: 10 mm with a flange of 1.5 mm (8.5 mm exposed), Diameter: 5 mm, flattened to 3 mm on the last 6 mm.
- Attachment holes, diameter 4.2 mm, 35 mm apart
- Shaft is 8 mm ahead of the attachment holes
- Main body: 19mm high, 28 mm diameter
- Connector creates a rectangulat protrusion at the back (adds 3 mm, 14.6 mm wide)

## Base

### Motor attachment

Plan 2 mm for gear pressure adjustment.

### Assembly holes

Plan for threaded inserts in the case (external diameter 4.5 for M3).
