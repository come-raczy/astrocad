# End Caps

## Parametrized end cap

This is a metric end cap with a female thread. The parameters are:

- Diameter in mm (e.g. 42 mm for M42)
- Thickness in mm (e.g. 1.5 mm for a part 1.5 mm thick)
- Tolerance in mm (e.g. 0.2 mm for generic 3D printing)
- Pitch in mm (e.g. 0.75 mm for M42x0.75)
- Length in mm (e.g. 5 mm for a thread of 5 mm)

## RC8 Collimation Cap

It is just an end cap with an M90x1 thread that can be screwed in place of the focuser.
The collimation cap has a pinhole (parametrized to 1.5 mi). It is recommended to print it in white to save the effort of
painting the inside in white later.
